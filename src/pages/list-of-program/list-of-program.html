      The sacred festival of Sakrambhari Navaratri is mainly celebrated here twice in a year. Mata Shakambhari is considered to be the incarnation of Shaky (vegetables) and Goddess of flora and Mother Parvati (Mother Durga). This festival is celebrated for the nine days dedicated to the Shukla Paksha of Paush month, beginning from the Ashtami of Paush Purnima, on the occasion of Shakmabhari Jayanti. Since tears rolled out from the eyes of the goddess continuously for 9 days and nights the biggest worship practice is the celebration of Navratra Mahotasav, held in the months of Chaitra and Ashwin for nine days each. Two more Navratras are also celebrated but they are known as "Gupt Navratras."

      The popularity of this temple has been increasing day by day and many devotees visit this temple for "Darshan". On the day of "Poush Purnima" a mela is organised at Shakambhari mata temple. Lakhs of people gathered in this mela. During this time the Rishis Munis, who came for Devi's Darshan, were welcomed and honored with vegetarian meals. Because of this the temple was named as Shakambari devi temple.
